`TradingIndicatoR` is an R package that computes some of the most known financial indicators (or technical trading indicators) in technical trading, based on past price levels and other historical data. All functions are designed to be compatible with regular vector or object of class [xts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xts/index.html).

Currently `TradingIndicatoR` offers the following indicators:

|Indicator|Function|
|:--------|:-------|
|Accumulation/Distribution Line|`ADL()`|
|Aroon|`Aroon()`|
|Aroon Oscillator|`AroonOscillator()`|
|Average True Range|`ATR()`|
|Bollinger Bands|`Bollinger()`|
|Balance of Power|`BOP()`|
|Exponential Moving Average|`MA()`|
|Arms Ease of Movement|`EVM()`|
|Ichimoku Kinko Hyo|`Ichimoku()`|
|Moving Average Convergence Divergence|`MACD()`|
|On Balance Volume|`OBV()`|
|Relative Strenght Index|`RSI()`|
|Simple Moving Average|`MA()`|
|Stochastic Oscillator|`StochOscillator()`|
|Stochastic RSI|`StochRSI()`|
|Weighted Moving Average|`MA()`|


Moreover the package offers some utilities such as `NormPrice()` function for normalizing prices and some sample datasets to experiment with. These are `TWTR`, `USGDP` and `BAC`.


We provide a [sample workflow](workflow.html) will introduce you to the package through a realistic simple analysis. 

Since this was a school project, if you want to know more about the difficulties encountered during the early development of the package, or the future developments we are considering for it follow this [link](future.html).

# About
